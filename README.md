# Cryptocurrency market analysis
## About

Having followed the and invested in cryptocurrency market for around 1 year, and participated a exchange service via Wechat for chinese users, I want to do some exploring in the data available from different online database:
[coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com)
[coinmetrics](https://coinmetrics.io/)
[blockchain](https://blockchain.info/charts)



To replicate, first head over to [coinmarketcap-scraper](https://github.com/prouast/coinmarketcap-scraper);
this lets you download data from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com) into a local database.
The script `analysis.R` can then be run on this database.
