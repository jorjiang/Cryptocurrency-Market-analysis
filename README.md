# Cryptocurrency market analysis
## About

Having followed the and invested in cryptocurrency market for around 1 year, and running an exchange service via Wechat for chinese users for a while, I want to do some exploring in the data available from different online database, to get more insight and also offer our data analysis service to our customer on our exchange, helping them make better investment decisions:
[coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com)
[coinmetrics](https://coinmetrics.io/)
[blockchain](https://blockchain.info/charts)



To replicate, first head over to [coinmarketcap-scraper](https://github.com/prouast/coinmarketcap-scraper);
this lets you download data from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com) into a local database.
The script `analysis.R` can then be run on this database.
